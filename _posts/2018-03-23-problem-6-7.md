# 6. Sum square difference
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 552 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

```python
sumofsq = 0
sqofsum = 0
for i in range(1, 101):
    sumofsq = sumofsq + i**2
    sqofsum = sqofsum + i
print( abs(sumofsq - sqofsum**2) )
```

# 7. 10001st prime
By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.

What is the 10001st prime number?


```python
num = 1
i = 0
while i < 10001:
    num += 1
    prime = 1
    for j in range(2, num):
        if num % j == 0:
            prime = 0
            break
    if prime == 1:
        i += 1

print("{}st prime is {}".format(i, num))
```
