# 1. Multiples of 3 and 5 
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

```python
num = 0
for i in range(999):
    if (i + 1) % 3 == 0 or (i + 1) % 5 == 0:
        num = num + (i + 1)

print(num)
```

# 2. Even Fibonacci numbers
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

```python
# 1
fibo = []
num = 1
fibo.append(num)

while num < 4000000:
    if num == 1:
        num = num + fibo[-1]
        fibo.append(num)
    else:
        num = fibo[-1] + fibo[-2]
        fibo.append(num)
fibo = fibo[:-1]

sum_number = 0
for number in fibo:
    if number % 2 == 0:
        sum_number += number

print(sum_number)

```

```python
# 2
sum = 0
a = 1
b = 1
while b < 400000:
    if b % 2 == 0:
        sum = sum + b
    h = a + b
    a = b
    b = h
print(sum)
```

# 3. Largest prime factor
The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

```python
targetnum = 600851475143
maxnum = 0
for i in range(2, targetnum):
    if targetnum % i == 0:
        maxnum = i
        targetnum = targetnum//i
    if targetnum == 1:
        break
print(maxnum)
```

# 4. Largest palindrome product

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

```python
max_p = 0
for i in reversed(range(100, 1000)):
    for j in reversed(range(100, 1000)):
        product = str(i*j)
        index = len(product)//2
        if product[:index] == product[-index:][::-1]:
            if int(product) > max_p:
                a, b, max_p = i, j, int(product)

print(a, b, max_p)
```

# 5. Smallest multiple
2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

```python
def check_prime(num):
    if num > 1:
        prime = 1
        for i in range(2, num):
            if num % i == 0:
                prime = 0
                return False
        if prime == 1:
            return True
    else:
        return False

    primenumbers = []
    for i in range(2, num):

            primenumbers.append(i)
    return primenumbers

li = []
for i in range(1, 21):
    if check_prime(i):
        li.append(i)
    else:
        primes = find_prime_below(i)
        factors = []
        while i != 1:
            if primes == []:
                break
            else:
                for p in primes:
                    if i % p == 0:
                        i = i // p
                        factors.append(p)
        for f in set(factors):
            if li.count(f) < factors.count(f):
                li = li + [f] * (factors.count(f) - li.count(f))

multiply = 1
for num in li:
    multiply *= num

print(multiply)
